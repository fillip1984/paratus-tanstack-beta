# Paratus

Productivity tool modelled after todoist

## Learning

Right now I'm using this project to learn:

- tanstack start/router which is still in beta
- tailwind v4
- formkit drag and drop
- tanstack forms
- tanstack query (latest version) which I have integrated with trpc
- SST latest for deployments

## What's next?

Usually I keep track of todos here in the readme file but since this is a productivity tool the todos are actually saved in a local database... sorry
Here's a highlight list though of what I have planned:

- [X] implement drag and drop
- [ ] build a very simple todoist clone that works on desktops (responsive web design is taking a backseat)
- [ ] deploy to aws as a lambda using latest SST (uses terraform)
- [ ] build a react native app to consume the backend
